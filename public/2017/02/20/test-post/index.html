<p>Throughout my graduate studies, I&rsquo;ve used R quite a bit and have grown fond of it. When it comes to doing data science and machine learning, R fits the bill nicely. Not to mention R has a huge following and is currently one of the most popular languages in the world. As a result, it has a very active community and a huge selection of packages that pretty much allows R to do anything you want like reproducible reporting.</p>

<p>One of the key skills of a data scientist is to communicate and share your analyses/models with your peers or stakeholders. If you can&rsquo;t effectively show what you did, then what&rsquo;s the point? The guys at RStudio have created a great solution called R Markdown. If you&rsquo;ve ever used Markdown, then you know how easy it is. R Markdown allows one to embed R code into a reporting document. Just start a new .Rmd file in RStudio and adjust the YAML front matter at the very top of the document and you&rsquo;re good to go. R Markdown borrows the syntax from vanilla Markdown where most of the difference is in parameterizing the code chunks. R Markdown is amazing for reproducibility. Also, anyone that&rsquo;s ever seen a R Markdown document knows it&rsquo;s one of the prettier looking documents. R Markdown even has the capability to embed Shiny apps/interactive widgets.</p>

<p>However, there is one drawback to R Markdown right now and that&rsquo;s blogging. In an ideal world, I would be in RStudio, writing a post in R Markdown and pushing it to github pages and be done with it. But it&rsquo;s not there yet. I&rsquo;ve seen many solutions from using Jekyll (which I haven&rsquo;t found to be easy) to spinning up your own AWS EC2 instance and setting up a blog there to host html files. Most seem like more work than it should be just to put up a nice looking R Markdown page. After much searching around, I found <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> by Yihui Xie, the man who created Knitr. Blogdown uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a blogging framework for static pages built using the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> language. One word of warning, blogdown is still under development, but I&rsquo;ve tested it out and there have been minor issues, but most of it is because there is no documentation right now if you&rsquo;re stuck. I&rsquo;ve had to go under the hood and look at the code to figure out what functions to run. Below I&rsquo;ll show a quick way to get set up so that blogging with R Markdown is joy from start to finish.</p>

<p>Assuming you already have R/RStudio installed, you&rsquo;ll need to download the blogdown package to your machine like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r, eval=FALSE">devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to install Hugo to your local machine using the blogdown function <code>install_hugo()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r, eval=FALSE">blogdown::install_hugo()
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can create a new directory for our webpage and make sure to set your working directory to that new directory. Once in your empty directory, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r, eval=FALSE">blogdown::new_site()
</code></pre>

<p>If the above does not work, make sure you are creating a completely empty directory. I ran into a few issues when I tried to run the above function on a directory with a .Rproj file in it. So remember, the directory will need to be <em>totally empty</em>.</p>

<p>The above command will generate all the necessary skeleton files needed to generate the blog and launch it in the console. It will also show a preview of your blog in the viewer window in RStudio. The above command also automatically downloads a theme, but this can easily be changed if you choose with the below command. You can find more Hugo themes at <a href="themes.gohugo.io">here</a>. My current theme is academic. You can change it to whatever you want by specifying the github repo and the theme name as shown below in quotes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r, eval=FALSE">blogdown::install_theme('gcushen/hugo-academic')
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind when you install a new theme, the config file <code>config.toml</code> will update to use the most recently downloaded theme as default. So to change it in the future just go into the <code>config.toml</code> file and adjust the <code>theme =</code> parameter to the name of the theme you want.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re happy with the theme, it&rsquo;s good practice to preview your blog before pushing it out to the world. Run the following in your console:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r, eval=FALSE">blogdown::serve_site()
</code></pre>
