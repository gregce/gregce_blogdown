<p>I believe it’s fitting that my first foray into blogging about <code>R</code> programming should be about a topic &amp; package (<code>tidyr</code>) that are essential to a practicing Data Scientist’s toolkit - data munging. Hadley Wickham’s package <a href="https://github.com/hadley/tidyr"><code>tidyr</code></a> provides a number of convenience functions to, in his words, ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each column is a variable.</li>
<li>Each row is an observation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this important you might ask? Well for a number of reasons but below are the most important two:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Many <code>R</code> functions expect a <code>data.frame</code> to be passed in as a parameter (i.e the fundamental data structure in R, which in most cases fits the definition of “tidy” above)</li>
<li>This standard, very akin to the relational database model developed by Codd, allows you to not have to reinvent a represtation at each go and rather focus on the analysis/exploration/visualization processes that got your excited about <code>R</code> programming in the first place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like most, I enjoy applied examples, and when I originally read Hadley’s original <a href="https://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/">Rstudio post</a> introducing <code>tidyr</code> I felt it was a bit lacking in explanation and didn’t necessarily help <code>tidyr</code> to truly shine. The purpose of this post is to show you how <code>tidyr</code>’s main features compares to common SQL commands used to pivot/un-pivot data as well as parse values into columns (which occaisionally may be difficult -&gt; impossible depending on your SQL flavor).</p>
<p>For the purpose of both clarity and brevity, I will only use the following packages in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tidyr</code>: the package of interest. Specially we’ll cover it’s four main verbs:
<ul>
<li><code>gather()</code></li>
<li><code>spread()</code></li>
<li><code>unite()</code></li>
<li><code>separate()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>SQLDF</code>: a package developed developed by G. Grothendieck that allows one to write SQL against data.frames</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code>: another one of Hadely’s packages that makes data manipulation in <code>R</code>, SQL-like</li>
<li><code>stringr</code>: yet another one of Hadley’s packages for string manipulation</li>
<li><code>RMedicareData</code>: a personal package I developed which can be used to source example data from <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/">data.medicare.gov/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To demonstrate the functionality of <code>tidyr</code>, I will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Source an example dataset</li>
<li>Demonstrate each of the <code>tidyr</code> functions of note</li>
<li>And finally, show the SQL, using <code>sqldf</code>, that would be required to conduct an analagous operation</li>
</ol>
<div id="source-our-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Source our data</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>library(RMedicareData)
list_data()
# source a dataset consisting of Readmissions and Death statistics as the hospital level
d &lt;- get_data(59)
# take a glimpse</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="demo-spread" class="section level1">
<h1>Demo Spread</h1>
</div>
<div id="source-our-data-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Source our data</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyr)
# source a dataset consisting of Readmissions and Death statistics as the hospital level
d1 &lt;- d %&gt;% 
  select(Hospital.Name, Measure.Name, Score) %&gt;% 
  spread(key = Measure.Name, value = Score)
# take a glimpse</code></pre>
</div>
